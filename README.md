# Evil Hangman

This program uses an algorithm to cheat at Hangman. Given a certain word length, the program will continually prune the list of possible remaining words to dodge the player's guesses. The full assignment can be found [here](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2011/schwarz-evil-hangman/).

# Data Structures

ArrayLists were used to store the dictionary as well as the player's guesses.\
A HashMap was used to map word patterns (Strings) to word lists (ArrayLists).

# Running the program

Compile and run PlayHangman.java
